# Wordle
###### Coming soon for a console near you

## Process Summary

1. Make a plan
2. Get sick
3. Get fewer results

-------------------------------------

## The Plan

### Need to haves - the basic game

- Wrong letters marked with grey
- Correct letters incorrectly placed marked with yellow
- Correct letters correctly placed marked with green
- letter can appears several times in the answer
  - if it does, extra letters in guess is checked against non-matched letters in answer
- limited number of guesses
- each word has 5 (five) letters
- only a number of predefined words count as guesses and get marked as such

In addition to this, testing and logging will be implemented.

-------------------------------------

## The Plan

### Nice to haves

- Winning Streak
- Time Limitation
- Multiplayer game (hotseating)
- Statistics
- Better interface, probably via Textual
- Pictogram for social media sharing

-------------------------------------

## The Plan

### Schedule

  Date   | Activity
-------- | ---------
Wed 18/2 | Research of frameworks and paradigms + Planning
Thu 19/2 | Software Requirements Specification + Rough Prototype + Test Setup
Fri 20/2 | Logging Setup + Implementation
Mon 23/2 | Implementation + Winning Streak
Wed 25/2 | Time Limitation + Hotseating
Thu 26/2 | Statistics
Fri 27/2 | Statistics + Buffer

-------------------------------------

## The Process

- got sick, impacting two workdays
  - buffer existed for this purpose
    - but it was insufficient this time
- unclear deadline
  - 'friday' - end-of or ready-for?
  - presentation as part of project, or after project deadline?
    - stated assumptions to stakeholder; worked with these in mind
